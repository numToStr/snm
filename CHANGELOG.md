# Changelog

## [0.8.0]

### Breaking

-   Rename active version alias from `default` to `active` [#89](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/89)

> If you are upgrading from an older version, `snm` will not recognize the running version. To fix this just run the `use` command with a version of your choice.

### Changes

-   Rename `prune` command to `purge` but retain `prune` as an alias [#82](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/82)

```shell
# Now both are valid
snm prune # just an alias to purge
snm purge
```

-   Add `--all` flag to `purge` command to also remove the active version [#82](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/82)

```shell
snm purge --all
```

-   Update `clap` to `v3.0.0-beta.2` [#84](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/84)

-   Make `<version>` argument optional in `snm which` [#86](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/86)

## [0.7.0] - 2021-08-09

I finally rewrote the whole program to be more idiomatic. Removing any unnecessary code, making the codebase more readable and maintainable. Sadly, in doing so I've to introduce some breaking change. I've listed the major changes below:

PR: [#79](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/79)

### Breaking

-   Previously, installation directories were all prefixed with the v character, now it is gone.

```shell
# before
$SNM_DIR/releases/v14.17.4

# now
$SNM_DIR/releases/14.17.4
```

-   From this version ownwards, MSRV will be `1.54.0`

### Changes

-   Previously, releases were downloaded into memory because of the progress bar implementation. Now they all are downloaded temporarily inside the `$SNM_DIR/downloads` and when the installation is finished, the downloads will be automatically deleted. Keep in mind, it will not delete automatically if the command is terminated by `CTRL-C` and friends.
-   `prune` command now also deletes `$SNM_DIR/downloads` if it is not empty.
-   Better progress bar implementation. Now the lag is gone, at least in the unix environment.
-   Removed spinner from `snm ls-remote` command
-   Replaced `colored` with `console` for terminal color output, as console was already used with `indicatif`.
-   Added concrete types for user alias, release/alias/download dir, etc.
-   Fixed some bugs that I found along the way.

### Misc

-   Bump `semver` to `v1` [#78](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/pull/78)
-   Fix clippy lint errors [74f16c2](https://github.com/numToStr/snm/commit/74f16c2fe631839a7013fb09fc4b150992650646)
